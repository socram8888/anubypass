A Chrome extension to bypass [Anubis](https://anubis.techaro.lol/)'s
protection.

It works by detecting when the browser is presented with a JavaScript challenge and switching the
User Agent to a random one, which Anubis lets through unchecked.

If you are a sysadmin and think that it's acceptable to make users wait while wasting precious
system resources on a protection so trivial to bypass that it took me around 100 lines of code, you
should consider switching to a crypto miner. At least you'd get some cash instead of a false sense
of security.
